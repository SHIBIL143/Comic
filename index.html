                <p>
                    One day, a rabbit named Mittu was sleeping under a tree when something suddenly hit him.
                    Startled, Mittu woke up to find a stone nearby...
                    <span class="more-text">
                        He looked around and saw a bear cub laughingâ€”it was the one who had thrown the stone! 
                        Without saying anything, Mittu walked away. After some time, Mittu heard a cry for help. 
                        Rushing to the source of the noise, he found the same bear cub, his face swollen from bee stings. 
                        Feeling sorry for him, Mittu told the cub not to worry and went to fetch some herbal leaves. 
                        He applied the remedy to the cub's face, and the pain quickly subsided. 
                        Mittu then gently scolded the bear cub, reminding him that just like he had been bothering everyone, 
                        he had also disturbed the bees. The bear cub agreed to stop his mischief from then on.
